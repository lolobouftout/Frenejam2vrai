1-Controls :

Space: Dash
During the dash: You can jump by pressing space again
That’s all. The game follows the "One Button" theme very literally.



2-Notes on the Current State of the Project:

I am aware that some elements may seem unusual in this version:
Some variable names in Unity are not very conventional.
You must dash before being able to jump.
The level is quite short.

This is intentional for now. I plan to rework and polish the project after the jam. Future improvements include:
-Walls that can only be passed through while dashing
-Traps that appear later in the level once the key (the dark yellow circle) has been collected
-Additional mechanics, more refined level design, and more content overall

I really enjoyed making this project. Even if it is not as complete as I would like it to be (we only had one week), I am still proud of the result and of the direction it is taking.


3-Final Note

Yes, the game looks a lot like Geometry Dash.
Any resemblance is purely coincidental, for sure.
